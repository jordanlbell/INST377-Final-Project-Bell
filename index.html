        This website interacts with the Prince George's County API "Crime
        Incidents February 2017 to Present" to visualize the crime on each
        block. The website only retrieves the first 1000 entries from the API
        which all occur during February of 2017. After following the
        instructions on the next page, the locations of crimes on the blocks you
        chose will appear on a map, and a list of the types of crimes commited will
        appear below in a list.
