Browsers: The project should fucntion well on any normal monitor, and works well on mobile except for the instructions

API: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json

Visualizations: The project uses leaflet.js to mark the locations of crimes commited on the map.

CSS Framework: I used a framework that is a mix of the one used from labs, as well as a lot of my own customization

The project is attempting to filter and display the crimes that occured on each block. This allows users to see exactly what areas might have common occurances of crimes, and better understand the areas they live in. It is also just an interesting visualization to see the locatiions where crimes have occured on the block. Since the data accessed it old, it does not accurtely reporesent or display anything meaningful to todays people, but it is still interesting to look at.
